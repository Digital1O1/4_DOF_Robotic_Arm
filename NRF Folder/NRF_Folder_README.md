# Purpose of this folder

To ensure the NRF boards are communicating with one another, upload the sketches/C++ code in the 'Hello World' folder

The other two folders serve as a starting point to send multiple values (floats, ints, ect.) from one microcontroller to another using the NRF2401 RF boards
