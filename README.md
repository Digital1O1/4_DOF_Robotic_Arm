# Intention Of 4_DOF_Robotic_Arm Project
1. Take gyroscopic/magnetometer/accelerometer data from an MPU_9250 to calculate the Yaw/Pitch/Roll
2. Using three nrf24l01 radio frequency development boards to transmit data wirelessly from one microcontroller (Teensy 4) to two other microcontrollers (Wedmos D1 | Arduino Nano)
3. Display on an SH1106 OLED display the calculated Yaw/Pitch/Roll values on the Transmitting Teensy while transferring the data to the other microcontrollers mentioned earlier
4. Recieving/displaying the transmitted data on another SH1006 OLED display utalizing a Wedmos D1 microcontroller while the Arduino Nano is also recieving/using the same transmitted data to control a 3-d printed, 4 Degree-of-Freedom robotic arm.
